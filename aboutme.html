    <h3><em>Education</em></h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      I am 29. I was born in raised in the Aksy region in village Zhylgyn.
      Zhylgyn is the second-closest village to a beautiful lake, Sary-chelek,
      after the Arkyt village<br /><br />
      After school, I came to Bishkek to study at university and graduated in
      2013 from Kyrgyz Turkish Manas University in Engineering of Food Science
      major.<br /><br />
      I loved my program because it included all types of chemical lessons that
      ever existed, which I hated at school. So, I should have loved it, as I
      didn't have other choices.<br /><br />
      But I truly enjoyed lessons such as thermodynamics, process control,
      manufacture design, biotechnology, sensory analysis.<br /><br />
      Also, we had the chance to visit food companies such as Coca- Cola, Kyrgyz
      Konyagy, Akun, Yashar, sugar productions.<br /><br />
      Except for the study, I was part of the University Dance team
      <strong>"Manastyn Kyzdary"</strong>.We were performing in all University
      cultural programs. Sometimes we were dancing at weddings and getting money
      for that).

    <h3><em>Work life</em></h3>
    <hr />
    <p>
      After graduation, I started my working life at the company
      <strong>"ejootrade"</strong>. Here I learned first about how to build
      customer relationships and how to sell products. Also, I was part of an
      amazing team.<br />
      In 2015 I moved to Istanbul, and here it started my career as a food
      engineer in the corporate field. <br /><br />Here I learned a lot about
      corporate business, life, strategy, etc. I had the chance to visit a lot
      of food productions in different countries, which widens my horizon.
