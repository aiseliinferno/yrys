    <h2>What I love?</h2>
    <p>In general, I am a curious person. I love everything, which includes a little creativity. <br><br>
      I love to read and watch documentaries and autobiographical books and films. <br><br>In the last two years, I started to love simplicity and minimalism in everything. So I am trying to stick to this lifestyle.<br><br>
      During the pandemic, I opened to myself yoga, which became my favorite type of activity.<br><br> Also, I am attending a hip-hop dance group, as I loved the culture behind it. And the Afro dance hall style I want to learn next.</p>
